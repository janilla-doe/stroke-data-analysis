# Stroke Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes healthcare stroke data to identify patterns and risk factors, using core Python without external libraries.

Built as part of my Master's coursework in Data Analytics.

## Project Structure
- `dataset_module.py`: Handles loading, reading, and basic cleaning of the dataset (CSV).
- `query_module.py`: Provides search, filter, and statistical query functionalities.
- `ui_module.py`: Command-line interface for users to interact with the dataset.

## Skills Used
- Python Programming (Core)
- File Handling (CSV operations)
- Data Structures (lists, dictionaries)
- Data Analysis (basic logic and calculations)
- Modular Programming
- Command-Line Interface (CLI Development)

## How to Run
- Ensure Python 3 is installed.
- Run `ui_module.py` to launch the program.
